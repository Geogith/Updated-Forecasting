# WEATHER FORECASTING ACROSS THE WORLD
    Purpose
    
 The goal of this analysis was to create Python script to visualize the weather of 500 plus cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Visual displays consisted of scatter plots of the relationship between Temperature versus Latitude, Humidity versus Latitude, Cloudiness versus Latitiude, and Wind Speed versus Latitude. Linear regressions for each relationship were created. These relationships were used to select ideal weather conditions for vacation planning. A weather check on these 500 cities using a series of successive API calls were used to retrieve and document the weather. This document could be used when considering future vacations in these cities.
 
    Results

External data for analysis was obtained using third party APIs with Python. Data was obtained and parsed from sources such as OpenWeatherMap, the US Census, OMDB, and the New York Times.

For this analysis, an outside data source was used for my data analysis. I used GET requests, converted JSON into a Python dictionary, read and applied API documentation, signed up and used an API Key, loaded JSON from API responses into a Pandas DataFrame, successfully used Google Maps and Places API to obtain information about geographic areas, and obtained a firm understanding of how to dissect new API documentation.
